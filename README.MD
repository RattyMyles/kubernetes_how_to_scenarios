## Introduction

Kubernetes is a powerful container orchestration platform used for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. This project aims to provide hands-on experience with Kubernetes through a series of guided lab scenarios.

## Getting Started

To get started with the lab scenarios, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
```
git clone https://github.com/RattyMyles/kubernetes_lab_scenarios.git
```


2. **Install Dependencies**: 
Make sure you have Kubernetes installed on your local machine or access to a Kubernetes cluster.

3. **Navigate to Lab Directories**: 
Each lab scenario is contained within its own directory. Navigate to the directory of the lab you want to work on.

4. **Follow the Instructions**: 
Each lab directory contains instructions on what you need to accomplish. Follow the instructions and complete the tasks.

## Lab Scenarios

Below is a list of available lab scenarios:

1. **Lab 1: Installing Minikube and Helm**

- **Description**: This lab guides you through the process of installing Minikube and Helm on a Ubuntu machine, providing you with the necessary tools to manage Kubernetes applications effectively.

- **Directory**: `lab1-install-minikube-and-helm/`
